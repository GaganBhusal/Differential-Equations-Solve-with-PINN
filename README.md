# ðŸ§  Differential Equation Solver with PINNs

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple and interactive app I built using **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve differential equations.

Right now, it supports the **1D Heat Equation**, but Iâ€™m planning to add more equations as I go. The whole idea is based on the PINN paper by Raissi et al., and Iâ€™ve tried to make the app user-friendly so anyone can play around with it.

## Try it Out!

ðŸ”— **Live App**: [https://differential.streamlit.app/](https://differential.streamlit.app/)

## What You Can Do

- Adjust **Initial** and **Boundary Conditions** as you want  
- Change the **equation parameters** to see how it affects the solution  
- See the results in a COOL **3D plot** that shows how things evolve over time

## Behind the Scenes

- Built using **Streamlit** for the frontend
- Solves PDEs using a **neural network** guided by physics (hence, PINN)
- Visualizes the temperature distribution over space and time

## Based On

This project is inspired by the original PINN paper:

> **Raissi, M., Perdikaris, P., & Karniadakis, G. E.**  
> *Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations.*  
> [arXiv:1711.10561](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10561)
